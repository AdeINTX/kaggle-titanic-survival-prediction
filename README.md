# kaggle-titanic-survival-prediction
This is a Getting Started project hosted by Kaggle which goal is to build a model to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and based on the real event of Titanic sinking disaster. For more info about this historical event, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic. 
In this project, I am following these data science pipelines: Initial analysis of the data,Exploratory Data Analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, model selection with cross validation (hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV), and submission to Kaggle (checking final score on Kaggle helped me to review the performance of my model on the unseen data).
One final note, many processes in these pipelines are inspired by Ahmed Besbes' post https://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-score-08134-in-titanic-kaggle-challenge.html. Thanks to him for providing such valuable guidance for this project.
